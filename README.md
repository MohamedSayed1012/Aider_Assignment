# Original Project Functionality

The original JavaScript Tetris project by Jake Gordon is a classic implementation of the
famous Tetris game using HTML5 and JavaScript. The original game features:
• A clean, canvas-based rendering of the Tetris game board
• Standard Tetris gameplay mechanics:

    o Falling blocks of different shapes (tetrominoes)
    o Rotation of pieces using the up arrow key
    o Movement of pieces left and right with arrow keys
    o Accelerated drop using the down arrow key
    o Instant drop with the spacebar
• Basic scoring system based on completed lines and levels
• Progressive difficulty with pieces falling faster as levels increase
• Simple, minimalist user interface showing:

    o Current score
    o Number of lines cleared
    o Current level
    o Next piece preview (single)
    
The original code is well-structured and organized into separate components handling:

    • Game loop and state management
    • Piece rendering and movement
    • Collision detection
    • Scoring calculations
    • User input handling

# Enhanced Features
I've expanded upon the original game by implementing three major feature sets that
enhance both gameplay and user experience:
1- Prompt Aider to insert the “+/–” button:

  new button with label ‘+/–’ into the calculator keypad. Hook its onClick to call a new
toggleSign function (to be created in calcLogic.js). Ensure it’s styled consistently—use the
existing button CSS classes.”

2-Memory Functionality (M+, M-, MR, MC)
  Adds a toggleSign(value) helper that returns -value for nonzero numbers and leaves 0 unchanged.
  Integrate it so the calculator uses it when the user clicks the new button.”

3- Keyboard Input Support
  Adds and tweaks the CSS so the ‘+/–’ button matches the size and hover styles of the other
  keypad buttons.

# Development with Aider

    I used Aider, an AI-assisted coding tool, to implement the features. The workflow typically
    followed these steps:
    1. Adding relevant files to Aider's context using /add
    2. Analyzing the code structure with targeted questions using /ask
    3. Requesting specific feature implementations with detailed requirements
    4. Reviewing proposed changes using /diff
    5. Testing implementations and providing feedback for refinements
    6. Committing successful implementations using /commit
# Code Quality Assurance

Throughout development, I maintained high code quality by:
    • Keeping consistent coding style with the original project
    • Adding comprehensive comments for new functionality
    • Modularizing new features to avoid code duplication
    • Ensuring proper error handling for localStorage operations

# Most Effective Command Combinations

    The most powerful Aider workflow patterns I discovered were:
    1. Context Building: /add followed by /ask to build understanding before making
    changes
    2. Iterative Development: /edit followed by /diff and /undo for exploring solutions
    3. Test-Driven Flow: /run to test followed by targeted feature requests for any issues
    discovered
